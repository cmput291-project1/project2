1. populate database with list of 100,000 records (key/data pairs)
	-create /tmp/user_db directory
	-create DB_BTREE, DB_HASH or IndexFile databases based on given start argument
	-for IndexFile: use SecondaryDatabase?
		-https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17275_01/html/java/com/sleepycat/db/SecondaryDatabase.html
	-reject any attempts to insert duplicate keys
	-all key/data pairs are strings of lower case 26 Roman chars
	-must be generated using a pseudo random number generator
	-the lengths of key and data are from 64 to 127 bytes, inclusive
	-can use sample program to help do this

2. Retrieve records with a given key
	-get key from user
	-look up the key from the records and get all the sets of data from it
	-say if key can't be found or if db isn't populated yet
	-needs to record time to do this and the number of records found

3. Retrieve records with a given data
	-get data from user
	-find every key/data pair where the data is the given data
	-say if data can't be found or if db isn't populated yet
	-needs to record time to do this and the number of records found

4. Retrieve records with a given range of key values
	-Randomly select the existing key and/or data values (from your populated database) to make sure that the key/data search is non-empty, and
         the range search returns 100-200 records.   (Note that lowering the value of the upper limit will reduce the number of records returned.)
	-find every key with a key value that is within the range
	-say if bd isn't populated yet
	-needs to record time to do this and the number of records found

5. Destroy the database
	-use database.close(); to close database connection
	-my_table.remove(SAMPLE_TABLE,null,null); to delete table file
	-needs to record time to do this after user enters 2 and the number of records found

6. Quit
	-make sure the database is destroyed or destroy it
	-delete /tmp/user_db directory
	-System.exit(1);
	

-helper methods
	-get key/data from user
		-make sure it's all lowercase and letter of the alphabet and between 64-127 bytes inclusive
